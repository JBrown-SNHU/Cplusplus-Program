Summary

Application is used to calculate interest in savings when money is invested into an account typical to that of a high-yield savings account.

The application makes use of header files to incorporate classes into the code for the purpose of creating an investment object that is manipulated using the main menu options located in the main(). 

I particular enjoyed making this project because it is very practical application that lets you get a visual on savings in a safe way, and it gave me the opportunity to learn and grow even more as a software developer.

I plan to incorporate the skills I learned in this project into other applications and other programming languages now that I know the benefit of doing so.
